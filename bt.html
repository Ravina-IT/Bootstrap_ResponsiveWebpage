    <h1>How to Show Emotion and Soul in Dance</h1>
    <p>
      The best dancers are mesmerizing when they perform because they’re able to
      draw you in with the emotion and soul they express through their
      movements. But how do they do it? There are actually specific, concrete
      things you can change about your dancing to make it more emotional and
      soulful, and we’ll show you how! The steps below will walk you through how
      to tap into your emotions while listening to music and translate them into
      dance so you can put on a great performance.

    <b><h4>PART-1: Selecting the Right Story and Music</h4></b><br />

    <img src="1.jfif" alt="1." width="100%" /><br />
    <p>
      1.Identify what subjects or feelings can be expressed by dance.
      <br /><br />
      deciding what song, play, or book you want to perform, ask yourself if the
      story you’re considering can be well communicated through the medium of
      dance. For example, just because your favorite book is Ulysses, doesn’t
      mean it’s a good choice for your next dance number. It may fill you with
      all kinds of emotions, but the word play and poetic quality of the novel
      makes it largely dependent on language. Similarly, fantasy or sci-fi genre
      narratives often rely on over-the-top visual elements. Even if you love
      the emotional element and soundtrack of a particular sci-fi movie, your
      audience might find it difficult to identify with the story and its
      attendant emotions without the visual components. Think instead about what
      stories you love and which aren’t tied so closely to language or visual
      effects. Folk tales, fables, and fairy tales are often great choices, as
      the stories are well-known and they communicate clear, strong, and
      changing emotions.

    <p>
      2.Pick music with fluctuating rhythms, moods, and dynamics. <br /><br />A
      high-energy pop song can fill you with a surge of positive emotion, but
      that’s probably the single feeling it communicates. If you’re looking to
      touch your audience with a more complex emotional experience, it’s better
      to choose a song containing varied stages and moods. For example, look for
      crescendos and decrescendos, as these gradual changes in the volume and
      quality of the music can be effectively reflected in your movements. A
      couple good examples of songs with building textures and varying dynamics
      are Stevie Wonder's Sir Duke and Rose Royce's Car Wash.

    <p>
      3.Ask yourself what you’re feeling when you listen to the chosen song.<br /><br />
      Before you begin to experiment with movement, take some time to listen to
      the music and register your feelings. Think about what physical sensations
      run through your body, what stories or times in your life come to mind,
      and what feelings emerge as you listen. Once you’ve identified your
      emotions, try to match them to different points in the song. For example,
      if the song starts out melancholy and contemplative for about thirty
      seconds, mark this out on a piece of accompanying sheet music. If it turns
      to a more energetic, uplifting mood after thirty seconds, make a notation
      at the thirty-second mark.

    <b><h4>PART-2: Translating Emotion into Dance</h4></b><br />
    <img src="4.jfif" alt="4." width="100%" /><br />
    <p>
      1.Know how certain motions and shapes are generally perceived.
      <br /><br />While dance is a highly subjective art form with no fixed
      rules of expression, studies have shown that certain types of movement
      tend to elicit specific emotions. For example, curved shapes and circular
      motions are typically perceived as peaceful and soothing, while straight
      lines and choppy gestures are understood as emphatic and even aggressive.
      Similarly, rapid, accelerating, and seemingly impulsive movements tend to
      signal happiness or buoyant emotion, while slower motions often portray
      sadness or pensiveness.
    </p>
    <img src="5.jfif" alt="5." width="100%" /><br />
    <p>
      2.Experiment with different motions and gestures. <br /><br />Once you
      know what motions and shapes tend to evoke certain emotions, think about
      how you would add your personal take. If the first minute of the song
      seems joyous, what hand and arm gestures would you use to convey joy? What
      position of the head, and legs could do so? Try out your ideas in the
      mirror to see how well the acted-out gesture matches the intended emotion,
      and practice gracefully transitioning between motions. The key to making
      this brainstorming session effective is keeping an open mind and
      experimenting with a broad range of motions. Even if you don’t end up
      using any of the specific moves you perform at this point, you can
      generate valuable ideas and inspiration for your eventual choreography.
    </p>

    <p>
      3.Focus on your chest movements. <br /><br />Researchers studying the way
      audiences watch dance performance have found that spectators tend to look
      to the dancer’s chest as a way of deciphering emotional content. This
      means that you should pay special attention to the way you hold and move
      your chest while dancing. For example, heaving or sighing motions indicate
      yearning or struggle, while a puffed-out chest can signify assertiveness
      and strength.

    <p>
      4.Match your arm movement to the musical mood. <br /><br />Arms are
      another important body part which observers use to understand a dancer’s
      emotion. To wit, dancers in one study were instructed to convey joy,
      sadness, and anger simply by adjusting their arm movements. In each case,
      audiences correctly identified the dancer’s target emotion. Generally,
      wide, swift arcs and rising motions indicate anger, arms stretched toward
      the front indicate joy, and slow motions with little movement in the
      elbows indicate sadness.

    <p>
      5.Lift your eyebrows and relax your jaw. <br /><br />While people tend to
      express emotion in daily life through varied facial expressions—for
      example, scowling when angry or frowning when sad—you should adjust your
      face differently when dancing. Rather than animatedly mirroring the
      emotions in your dance, you should strive for an open expression—typically
      characterized by lightly arched eyebrows and a relaxed jaw—like the one
      you would adopt when listening to a friend’s confidences. This expression
      allows you to engage the audience without pantomiming. Some forms of dance
      such as gymnastics dance or pom squad require the dancer to hold a fixed
      grin throughout their routine.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      6.Make eye contact with the audience. <br /><br />It can be tempting to
      look at the floor when dancing, either because you’re concentrating on
      bodily movement or you’re battling with stage fright. In order to show
      emotion when dancing, though, you’ll need to look out at the audience and,
      if possible, make eye contact. This is because the eyes are one of—if not
      the most—expressive facial features, and humans rely on eye contact for
      meaningful interaction.
    </p>
    <br />
    <img src="10.jfif" alt="10." width="100%" /><br />
    <p>
      7.Practice your routine for a coach or friend. <br /><br />Often times,
      what seems sufficiently pronounced or emphatic from a dancer’s perspective
      doesn’t come across to the observer, so it’s essential to get feedback
      from another pair of eyes. Run through your routine with a friend, fellow
      dancer, or coach and ask them to watch specifically for how well you’re
      emoting. If you’re not effectively expressing emotion, strive to stretch
      your limbs, lift your chin, and exaggerate your motions.
